# [HTML5 Boilerplate Minimal](http://html5boilerplate.com)

HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or sites. 

This is a fork that pares down the original. It is intended to be useful for spinning up
quick front-end demos without having to first set up the necessary web documents.
